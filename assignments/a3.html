                    Prepare a reflective journal.
                    For each of the first five classes, you must submit a short journal entry of at least 100 words within 24 hours of the conclusion of class.
                    The final entry, of approximately 1000 words may be submitted before 9pm on Sunday 24 July 2016.
                    Your journal should show critical reflection as well as insights into how you may apply the ICI practices to your own discipline of expertise.

                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    A reflective journal is a tool for thinking about your learning.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A reflective journal has a different focus to an essay or report.
                    When writing reports or essays, you study and think deeply about a particular topic that is external to yourself. 
                    In contrast, in a reflective journal, you direct your attention inwards. 
                    You apply critical thought and deeper thinking to your own learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After each class, you must write your reflections, describing how you are mkaing sense of the journey you are on in this subject.
                    You will collect these written entries into a journal.
                </p>
                <h3>Writing a Journal Entry</h3>
                <p>
                    Each journal entry should address your learning experience on three levels:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Descriptive:</b> What happened? What did you do, hear, see or otherwise experience?</li>
                    <li><b>Analytical:</b> How do you make sense of what happened? How does what you experienced relate to what you know and other things you have experienced?</li>
                    <li><b>Reflective:</b> How is this useful for you? How have you changed as a result of the experience? What questions do you have now and where will you apply it in future?</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Some of the following questions may assist you in thinking more deeply about your learning experience:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In your opinion, what was the point of the day&rsquo;s class?</li>
                    <li>What new knowledge, skills and approaches have you gained from the class?</li>
                    <li>What did you struggle with?</li>
                    <li>What do you plan to explore later?</li>
                    <li>How did you feel?</li>
                    <li>How could you apply the practices that you learnt to your own discipline?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    A good journal entry should explore what you have learnt, how your thinking has changed and what new opportunities you see.
                    The journal should demonstrate growth, learning from &lsquo;failure&rsquo; and introspection into your struggles with the subject content.
                </p>
                <h3>Final Entry</h3>
                <p>
                    The final journal entry should incorporate reflection over the entire subject.
                    Consider what you have learnt as a result of the subject as a whole.
                    How will you apply your new insights beyond the subject?
                </p>

                <h2>Word Limits</h2>
                <p>
                    The word limits are a guide. 
                    However, as a guide, we expect most minor submissions to consist of 100 to 200 words of written text.
                    The major submission should be 1000 to 1500 words.
                    Clarity and succinctness is an important dimension of the marking criteria.
                    A long submission is unlikely to be succinct and clear.

                <p>
