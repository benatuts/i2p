                    Working in groups of three or four, you will select a challenge or a combination of challenges posed by an apparent impossibility.
                    Your objective is then to test the challenge: you will create a series of experiments, observational activities and prototypes that will advance your understanding of the challenge.
                    You will then prepare an engaging presentation that highlights the surprising discoveries that you have made.

                <h2>Task</h2>
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    In Assignment 1, your group members each worked separately in a common opportunity space.
                    After the deadline for Assignment 1, you will share your ideas and insights with each other in class.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this assignment, you will conduct a series of experiments or studies that help bring insight to an impossibility.
                    You will then prepare a compelling report and presentation on your findings.
                </p>
                <h3>Agree on a Challenge</h3>
                <p>
                    In class, you should reach collective agreement on a dimension or bottleneck from the impossibilities framework that you will explore further.
                    You might choose a dimension that was common across your group&rsquo;s Assignment 1 Part B responses.
                    You might choose a new combination of your Assignment 1 submissions.
                    It should be a problem that you all feel inspired to explore.
                </p>
                <h3>Conduct a Series of Experiments</h3>
                <p>
                    You will conduct a series of experiments or observational studies that provide insight into the challenge.
                    This should be performed iteratively: you will plan an experiment, conduct the experiment, discuss your findings and then plan a new experiment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For each experiment you perform, you will need to consider the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The objective of the study</li>
                    <li>The methods you will use to conduct the study</li>
                    <li>What you will measure or observe</li>
                    <li>The methods you will use to analyse or interpret the observations</li>
                    <li>The &lsquo;props&rsquo;, equipment and people you will need</li>
                    <li>The ethical impact of your work and any risks associated with the study</li>
                    <li>A rough protocol that describes the steps in your study</li>
                    <li>How you will allocate the work and responsibilities among your group members</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    As you go, write down these ideas in bullet-point form.
                    You need to discuss each experiment with a member of the teaching team before you conduct the experiment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You should expect to perform at least four iterations of experimentation as your understanding of the problem domain improves.
                    Your early studies are likely to be more observational, while your final studies will incorporate elements of a concrete prototype.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note that you must <b>do</b> something.
                    It is not appropriate to simply conduct a literature review or library-based research.
                </p>
                <h3>Inspire Others</h3>
                <p>
                    Once you&rsquo;ve completed your experiments, you should look back at all that you have learnt.
                    You will need to combine your insights and prepare a compelling presentation as a group.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Day 5 will revolve around a workshop on story-telling.
                    It will give you a chance to experiment with different communication styles and discover a voice for your presentation.
                    You can use those lessons and ideas to prepare a compelling 10 minute presentation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the final day of class (Day 6) you will deliver your presentation to your classmates.
                    Inspire them with your findings.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="section deliverable">
                <h2>Deliverables</h2>
                <p>
                    For this assignment, you will be assessed on your experiments and your final presentation. These are two separate deliverables.
                </p>
                <h3>Part A (10%)</h3>
                <p>
                    Each time you iterate your experiment, you will prepare a succinct (e.g., half-page) plan of your experiment.
                    You will show your plan to a member of the subject teaching team for approval before commencing each experiment.
                    With each new iteration, create a new copy of the summary and modify as appropriate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before the assignment due-date, combine your experiment plans together in a single document.
                    Save your raw data from your experiments in an appropriate format (e.g., Excel Spreadsheet).
                    Submit the combined document of your plans along with the raw data to UTS Online (before the due date).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bullet points are acceptable: you are assessed on your process and on the experimental design, not whether you can write an essay.
                </p>
                <h3>Part B (40%)</h3>
                <p>
                    Your presentation will be delivered to your peers in the final day of class.
                    It should communicate the following:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Your opportunity space, your future scenario and the underlying contradictions and challenges that make this an apparent &lsquo;impossibility&rsquo;</li>
                    <li>What you set out to explore</li>
                    <li>An explanation of how your understanding of the problem domain and its challenges has evolved as a result of your study</li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each group member should contribute to the presentation in roughly equal measure</li>
                    <li>A 10-minute time limit will be strictly enforced</li>
                    <li>Use appropriate props and/or slides to clearly communicate your message in a compelling, inspiring and engaging way</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section rules">
                <h2>Word Limits</h2>
                <p>
                    There is no fixed word limit. However, as a guide, we expect part B submissions to consist of no more than 1500 words or two pages of written text (in 12-point font).
                    Clarity and succinctness is an important dimension of the marking criteria.
                    A long submission is unlikely to be succinct and clear.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is no word limit for raw data.
                </p>
                <h2>Illustrations</h2>
                <p>
                    You are permitted (but not required) to use supporting diagrams, illustrations, photographs, videos, software and/or physical models.
                    These do not count towards the word limit.
                </p>
                <h2>Group Work</h2>
                <p>
                    This is a group assignment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Part A will be marked as a group and all group members will receive the same mark.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Part B will be marked as a group, and then individual marks are allocated on the basis of a peer assessment process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is expected that group members will contribute equally to the assignment.
                    Please discuss with the teaching team if a group member is not contributing to the assignment (or if you are not given opportunities to contribute).
                    A student who contributes nothing may receive zero marks for the assignment.
                    The use of email, Google Docs or other tools that provide an &lsquo;audit&rsquo; trail will assist your tutor in understanding the contribution of each group member in the event of dispute.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Based on consultation with group members and/or an analysis of the individual contributions, teaching staff may override peer assessment to more fairly reflect contributions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are experiencing group problems, do not wait until the &ldquo;last minute&rdquo;.
                    Discuss with teaching staff as soon as possible so that there is sufficient time to correct any issues or negotiate a solution.
                </p>
                <h3>Peer Assessment</h3>
                <p>
                    For peer assessment, your group will negotiate the allocation of 12 shares among each of you.
                    Groups with equal contribution should allocate these shares evenly (e.g., a group of 3 would allocate 4 shares to each member).
                    There is little point in arguing over minor differences.
                    However significant variation in individual contributions should be reflected in the share allocation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your final mark for Part B will be calculated by the following algorithm:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Multiply your group&rsquo;s Part B result by the number of group members</li>
                    <li>Divide by 12</li>
                    <li>Multiply by your number of shares to get your individual grade</li>
                    <li>This is capped to a maximum of 40</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    As computer code or an Excel formula:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>your_grade = max(40, group_grade * number_of_group_members / 12 * your_shares)</code></li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In other words, if all group members contributed equally, you will all receive the group grade. 
                    If the contribution was not equal, then the grade will be increased or decreased in proportion with how you have allocated your shares.
