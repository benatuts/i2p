                    Prepare an engaging report that (a) creatively interprets the opportunity space and (b) identifies a future scenario and explores why the scenario appears to be impossible.

                    This assignment is designed to assess the following objectives from the subject outline:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li value="1">Identify, describe and explore a range of challenges in order to discern significant opportunities and generate possibilities</li>
                    <li value="3">Explore and describe a complex environment as an interrelated map of humanity</li>
                    <li value="4">Select, test and evaluate different disciplinary methods for gaining insights into a complex system</li>
                    <li value="5">Frame and communicate experiences, ideas and findings to see the problem or context differently</li>

            <div class="section task">
                <h2>Task</h2>
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    Before commencing this assessment, you will form a group of three or four.
                    In your group you will identify an initial opportunity space to explore the challenge question &ldquo;How could robots be helpful, socially?&rdquo; 
                    Your opportunity space should be one that you will be able to explore on or near the university campus.
                    Your opportunity space should be reasonably specific (e.g., &ldquo;getting an ID at a student centre&rdquo; or &ldquo;the first day experience&rdquo; or &ldquo;finding love while studying&rdquo;).
                    Your opportunity space should not describe a particular solution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this assignment you will use ICI practices to think about the opportunity space.
                    You will then
                </p>
                <p>
                    In class, you will have developed an impossibilities framework with your peers and group-mates.
                    In this assessment, you will work alone to apply ICI practices to: explore the opportunity space; imagine an impossible future scenario; and analyze that scenario.
                </p>
                <h3>Explore</h3>
                <p>
                    First you will need to explore the opportunity space with an open mind.
                    Use the subject readings and in-class discussion as a starting point for your own exploration of the field of social robotics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Identify three to five ideas, trends, robots, applications or technological innovations related to social robotics.
                    They should have captured <b>your</b> imagination or interest.
                    They may be sourced from articles, book chapters, press stories, advertisements, talks, videos, movies or artworks.
                    They should be rich enough to raise questions and responses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Find connections between the ideas that you have identified: how are the ideas related to each other?
                    You should use a variety of methods and practices to discover connections, patterns or new insights.
                    You might use methods and practices from ICI, Social Robotics, your own discipline and other disciplines.
                </p>
                <p>For example, one possible combination of methods and practices could be the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Interview people, and</li>
                    <li>Write use cases, and</li>
                    <li>Identify transactions, power structures and beneficiaries, and</li>
                    <li>Create an experiential map</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Imagine</h3>
                <p>
                    Next, you will should imagine a bold and seemingly impossible future scenario where robots are helping socially, in your opportunity space.
                    Use your insights from your explorations, and your application of ICI methods and practices to generate the scenario.
                </p>
                <h3>Analyze</h3>
                <p>
                    Finally, use the impossibilities framework from class to speculate on the challenges of your imagined future scenario.
                    Identify the bottlenecks and underlying challenges.
                    Why is it impossible today?
                    What kind of insights and discoveries would bring it into the realm of possibility?
                </p>

            <div class="section deliverable">
                <h2>Deliverables</h2>
                <p>
                    For this assignment, you will submit a written report to UTS online.
                    The report should be in two parts, totalling approximately two pages.
                    The report should be a short summary of your insights.
                    It should be written in an interesting and engaging way.
                    It should communicate your ideas to your peers who may be from different disciplines but who are open to new and perhaps challenging ideas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The report will be marked in two parts. These are detailed below.
                </p>
                <h3>Part A (20%)</h3>
                <p>
                    Part A should describe your imagined future scenario and the exploration that lead you to imagine the scenario.
                    Describe your bold and seemingly impossible future scenario: bring it to life in the mind of the reader.
                    Explain how the ideas, trends, methods, practices and insights that you used have lead you to imagine that future possibility.
                </p>
                <h3>Part B (10%)</h3>
                <p>
                    Part B should use the impossibilities framework from class to bring insight to the problem.
                    Even though the future scenario appears to be impossible, use the framework to break the challenge into more managable parts or to relate the challenge to other apparent impossibilities past, present or future.
                </p>

            <div class="section rules">
                <h2>Word Limits</h2>
                <p>
                    There is no hard word limit.
                    However, as a guide, we expect most submissions to consist of 1500 words or two pages of written text (in 12-point font).
                    Clarity and succinctness is an important dimension of the marking criteria. A long submission is unlikely to be succinct and clear.
                </p>

                <h2>Illustrations</h2>
                <p>
                    You are permitted (but not required) to use supporting diagrams, illustrations, photographs, videos, software and/or physical models.
                    These do not count towards the word limit.
                    If a supporting material cannot be uploaded to UTS online, it may be handed to the subject coordinator the following day.
                    However, all work must be completed prior to the deadline and photographs or other evidence of this should be included in the report that you upload.
                </p>
                <h2>Group Work</h2>
                <p>
                    While each member of your group will be working on the same opportunity space, this assignment is individual work.
                    We would expect that each member of the group will select different methods and anticipate different future scenarios.
                    Coincidental similarities will inevitably occur but each submission should be original work prepared without reference to your other group members.

                    Take risks and be daring.
                    You will be assessed on your application of transdisciplinary practices and methods, as opposed to whether your answers are &ldquo;right&rdquo; or &ldquo;wrong&rdquo;.
